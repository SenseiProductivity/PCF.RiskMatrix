# PCF Risk Matrix

A risk matrix built with PowerApps Component Framework for embedding on a Dynamics 365 form view.
This is a DataSet component intended to be used in-place of the default control in order to display a grid of counts based on calculated risk score (likelihood x consequence).

On first release only a 5 x 5 grid will be supported, however in the near future grid sizing will be dynamic based on configuration.
Ratings must be whole numbers between 1 and 5.
